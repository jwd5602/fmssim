first, remove the old argfile, otherwise the new information
will be appended to the old argfile

to generate events and build an argfile (list of events headed toward FMS),
run GenerateEvents.C (arguments specifiy # events and sqrt(s))

now an argfile (table of particles and momenta to send to geant)
will be created in outgen directory, together with events.root
that contains some statistics on the generated events; what gets stored in the
argfile is depenedent on the "argfile cut" in Analysis::BuildArgFile method
 - this cut is currently set for specified final state particles aimed 
   toward the FMS (2.5<eta<4.0)

if for any reason you want to rebuild the argfile (e.g., to look at specific
particles), run RebuildArgfile.C (takes events.root as input as well as
sqrts (make sure this matches!). To modify what gets put into the argfile,
change the "argfile cut" in Analysis::BuildArgFile and recompile

you can run Analyse.C on events.root for further analysis of the generated
event set

now cd to geant4/fms and run MkMacros (default argument should be set to the
default location of argfile - this script will generate macros in outroot, so 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT OVERWRITING SOMETHING IMPORTANT!
(this script uses calls to shoot-particle in batch mode - there's probably a 
better way to do this, but this way works ok)

the new macro set will be in the current outroot directory, ready to be run with
geant4 code!
